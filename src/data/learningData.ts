          { title: 'Why Daily Hygiene Matters', content: 'Your mouth is home to hundreds of bacterial species. Without daily cleaning, these bacteria form a sticky film called plaque on your teeth. Within 24-48 hours, plaque hardens into tartar—a substance that only a dental professional can remove. Daily brushing and flossing disrupt this process.' },
          { title: 'The Ideal Routine', content: 'Brush twice a day (morning and night) for 2 full minutes each time. Floss once daily, ideally before bedtime. Rinse with an antimicrobial mouthwash. Clean your tongue every morning to remove bacteria that cause bad breath.' },
          { title: 'Common Mistakes to Avoid', content: 'Brushing too hard damages enamel and recedes gums. Skipping nighttime brushing allows bacteria to work undisturbed for hours. Rinsing immediately after brushing washes away protective fluoride. Using the same worn-out toothbrush for too long reduces effectiveness.' },

          { title: 'Stage 2: Dentin Decay', content: "Once decay penetrates through enamel into the dentin (softer inner layer), a cavity has officially formed. Dentin is less hard than enamel, so decay spreads faster. You'll likely experience sensitivity to sweet, hot, or cold foods. A dental filling is now required to stop the progression." },
          { title: 'Stage 3: Pulp Involvement', content: "The pulp contains nerves and blood vessels. When decay reaches this stage, you'll experience severe, often spontaneous tooth pain.

A crown is usually placed afterward." },
